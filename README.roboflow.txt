Car Detection Project
This project uses YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8) to perform object detection on a custom dataset of cars. The dataset was collected using Roboflow, and the model was trained using Ultralytics YOLO. The trained model is then used to perform inference on new images.

Project Setup
1. Dataset Collection (Roboflow)
The dataset was collected using Roboflow to gather images of cars.
The data was pre-processed and annotated using Roboflow, which generates the necessary annotations and data.yaml file for YOLO.
2. Environment Setup
To run the model training and inference, ensure you have the following Python package installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install ultralytics
3. Training the Model
The model is trained on the custom dataset for car detection. The following command is used to train the model:

bash
Copy code
yolo task=detect mode=train data="####path to data.yaml#####" model="yolov8n.pt" epochs=10 imgsz=640 batch=16 project="######output path#######" name="train"
data: Path to the data.yaml file that contains information about the dataset.
model: Path to the pre-trained YOLOv8 model (e.g., yolov8n.pt).
epochs: The number of epochs for training.
imgsz: Image size used during training.
batch: Batch size for training.
project: Path where the output files will be saved.
name: Name for the experiment.
4. Prediction
After the model is trained, you can use the following command to perform inference on an image:

bash
Copy code
yolo task=detect mode=predict model="E:\output\train\weights" source="E:\cars dataset\download (1).jpeg"
model: Path to the trained model weights.
source: Path to the image on which the inference will be performed.
5. Output
The output of the model will be an image with detected objects (cars in this case), along with bounding boxes and confidence scores.

Example of Using the Model
Training the model:

bash
Copy code
yolo task=detect mode=train data="path/to/data.yaml" model="yolov8n.pt" epochs=10 imgsz=640 batch=16 project="output" name="train"
Prediction: After the model is trained, run inference using:

bash
Copy code
yolo task=detect mode=predict model="E:/output/train/weights" source="E:/cars dataset/download (1).jpeg"
